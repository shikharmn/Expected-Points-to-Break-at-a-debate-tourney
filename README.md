### Expected Points to Break at a Debate Tourney
This program calculates the expected value of points of the last breaking team after randomly running 10,000 simulations.
Enter the number of teams, rounds and breaks when prompted, that the tournament you are going to has. The number of teams MUST be divisible by four.
You should see an expected value as an output.
For large tournaments give the program a bit of time to calculate.
